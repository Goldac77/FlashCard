things i'll need to keep in mind for general design:
1. bootstrap slideshow/carousel
--this is for the slideshow of the flashcards
--the cards will have two buttons at the button;
--skip button is active if no answer is selected
--next button if an answer is selected
--the slideshow will have indicators
--check here for reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/#usage

2. answers will be buttons with hover effects(background-color change, box-shadow change, etc..)
